# Testing Champion Skill

Guidelines for ensuring project reliability and preventing regressions.

## Test Pyramid
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and logic in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between different modules.
- **E2E Tests**: Test critical user flows from end to end.

## Requirements
- Maintain high test coverage for critical paths.
- Write descriptive test cases.
- Run tests in CI before merging.
